# Credit-Card-Analytics-Dashboard

This project delivers an end-to-end Credit Card Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, split into two interactive reports:

1. Credit Card Customer Report – Provides demographic insights such as age group, gender, income level, and customer segment distribution. Helps financial institutions understand their customer base and retention opportunities.

2. Credit Card Transaction Report – Analyzes transaction-level details, including spending categories, regional distribution, payment methods, and high-value transactions.

Both dashboards include KPIs like total transactions, average spend, customer count, and revenue contribution by segment. Users can interact with slicers and filters for drill-down analysis across time, region, and category. By combining customer and transaction insights, the project demonstrates how Power BI can be leveraged for financial data visualization, enabling data-driven strategies for credit card usage growth, risk management, and customer engagement.
